# Networking-workshop
Find here materials for a 2-day workshop deep diving in Azure networking, including slides and a lab. The agenda for the 2-day version of the workshop looks like this:

* Day 1: theory
  - The main materials are contained in a single PowerPoint presentation [here](https://github.com/CSA-OCP-GER/Networking-workshop/raw/master/Azure%20Networking%20Full%20Workshop%20Deck%20-%20Public.pptx).
  - You can go through the presentation linearly, or you can use the hyperlinks in the agenda slide to go to each section separately. 
* Day 2: hands-on
  - Most concepts (being ExpressRoute a notable exception) are illustrated in [this lab](https://github.com/erjosito/azure-networking-lab): S2S VPNs, Vnet Peering, NVA HA
  - The lab leverages extensively the Azure CLI 2.0, therefore it can be used on Windows, Mac or Linux computers.
